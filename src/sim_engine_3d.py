# this file will instantiate a system

# read in .mdl file - prefer to have .mdl file input at command line
#     also command line - flags for desired returned values
# parse model parameters

# maybe do a loop through the .mdl file to count number of constraints
# and instantiate the constraints based on the type name
# @TODO: write .mdl parser and create system in this file
